## About Me

I’m a Ph.D. student at National Taiwan University, part of the AIMM group in the Communication and Multimedia Lab (CMLab), advised by Prof. Wen-Huang Cheng. My academic journey began with traditional machine learning techniques like SVMs and decision trees for rainfall forecasting during my master’s. I later worked at Academia Sinica on spatial-temporal modeling with deep learning and supported paper reviews for top-tier ML conferences.

I then spent over 5 years in industry at Authme as an AI Team Lead and CV/ML Engineer, where I led the development of end-to-end AI solutions for biometric security, OCR, and fraud detection—covering algorithm design, C++ SDKs, cloud infrastructure, and MLOps. My work has earned top rankings in international challenges such as CVPR, ICCV, and NIST FRTE. Currently, I’m expanding my research into vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision**: Image recognition, object detection, image segmentation, video understanding, and anomaly detection.
- **Deep Learing**: Domain generalization, self-supervised learning, vision-language models (VLMs), multimodal large language models (MLLMs), image-text matching, multimodal pretraining, knowledge distillation, model compression, and transfer learning.
- **Biometric AI**: Face recognition, face anti-spoofing, fraud detection, and deepfake detection.

## News

- **[Jul. 2025]** Our paper on face anti-spoofing with vision-language models (VLMs) has been accepted to ACM Multimedia 2025.
